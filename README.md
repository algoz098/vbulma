## VBulma - A Vue-cli template for speed developing using Bulma CSS
### Why?
I spend too much time making, copy, pasting and organizing my vue-components, so, i make them once, build a template for vue-cli, and every one can use.
### Too much in every file
This was build for my projects, so this template will have the things i need, you are welcome to fork, ask, use and sell it, and i will make it bigger and better.
Feel free to ask.
## Installation
You need vue-cli to this, install it:
```
npm install -g vue-cli
```

Then use the template
```
vue init algoz098/vbulma my-project
```
## Documentation
The documentation will come soon. Sorry.
